## MAIIA - Frontend Technical Test


## What I did:
- All the Required things (hopefully)
- Focused on doing things that would work on maiia production website (millions of everything. I did not write very optimized code, but it won't crash at least :D )


## What I did not do:
- Did not use redux a lot, cause i don't think that these data models should be stored in redux.
- Polish the UI, cause I don't like wasting time in what the designer should do (again i have seen maiia's website, and they do have very good designers)
- Did not enjoy the test. 


## I Copied code for Table from:
- [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/lydiacupery/infinite-scroll-example) ,don't know if this guy copied it from elsewhere

### Sending by email, (Did not upload to git for copyright issues), removed node modules (to reduce size)
